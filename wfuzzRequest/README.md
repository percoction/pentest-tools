Wrapper for wfuzz that allows you to run wfuzz based off of an existing HTTP request.
Specify a singular parameter to FUZZ (this is my most common use case..in the future I
    can build in fuzzing for multiple parameters)
and the wordlist that you want to use.
wfuzzRequest will automatically parse the HTTP request from the file then formulate and
    run the wfuzz command in the shell.

Usage:
    wfuzzRequest.py request.txt param wordlist.txt
